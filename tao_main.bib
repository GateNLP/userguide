                   techniques we used to adapt the approach for the
                   specifics of the F-term patent classification subtask
                   at NTCIR-6 Patent Retrieval Task. Our system obtained
                   the best results according to two of the three
                   measures used for performance evaluation. Moreover,
                   the results from some additional experiments
                   demonstrate that our system has benefited from the
                   SVM adaptations which we carried out. It also
                   benefited from using the full patent text in addition
                   to using the F-term description as extra training
                   material. However, our results using an SVMvariant
                   designed for hierarchical classification were much
                   worse than those achieved with flat SVM
                   classification. At the end of the paper we discuss
                   the possible reasons for this, in the context of the
                   F-term classification task},

                   today's ontologies need to be dynamic, networked
                   structures. One important challenge, therefore, is to
                   develop an integrated approach to the evolution
                   process of ontologies and related metadata. Within
                   this context, the specific goal of this work is to
                   capture the evolution of metadata due to changed
                   concepts, relations or metadata in one of the
                   ontologies, and to capture changes to the ontology
                   caused by changes to the metadata. After a short
                   discussion of the nature of metadata, we propose a
                   methodology to capture (1) the evolution of metadata
                   induced by changes to the ontologies, and (2) the
                   evolution of the ontology induced by changes to the
                   underlying metadata. This will lead to the
                   implementation of an approach for evolution of
                   metadata related to ontologies},

                   (IE) has tried to make use of knowledge from the
                   target ontology in order to improve semantic
                   annotation results. However, very few approaches
                   exploit the ontology structure itself, and those that
                   do so, have some limitations. This paper introduces a
                   hierarchical learning approach for IE, which uses the
                   target ontology as an essential part of the
                   extraction process, by taking into account the
                   relations between concepts. The approach is evaluated
                   on the largest available seman-tically annotated
                   corpus. The results demonstrate clearly the benefits
                   of using knowledge from the ontology as input to the
                   information extraction process. We also demonstrate
                   the advantages of our approach over other

  abstract =      {Some classification problems, such as the NTCIR-06
                   F-term patent classification task, have general or
                   specific relations between the target class labels.
                   Consequently, in such cases, it is desirable that the
                   relations among the labels can be taken into account
                   in the evaluation measures. For example, if a system
                   assigns an incorrect label to one instance and the
                   assigned label has close relation with the true
                   label, then the system may deserve some credit,
                   rather than being given no credit at all as is the
                   case with conventional evaluation measures. In this
                   paper we propose some new evaluation measures based
                   on relations among classification labels, which can
                   be seen as the label relation sensitive version of
                   some important evaluation measures such as averaged
                   precision and F-measure. We also present the results
                   of applying the new evaluation measures to all
                   submitted runs for the NTCIR-6 F-term patent
                   classification task. The new measure did change the
                   ranking positions of some runs (including the top
                   runs in some cases) made by the conventional measure,

                   in an ontology refer to the same object in the real
                   world. More specifically, this paper addresses the
                   instance unification problem for person names. The
                   approach combines the use of citation information
                   (i.e., abstract, initials, titles and co-authorship
                   information) with web mining, in order to gather
                   additional evidence for the instance unification
                   algorithm. The method is evaluated on two datasets
                   --- one from the BT digital library and one used in
                   previous work on name disambiguation. The results
                   show that the information mined from the web
                   contributes substantially towards the successful
                   handling of highly ambiguous cases which lowered the
                   performance of previous methods.},

                   technologies to solve software engineering related
                   problems show promising results, the very basic
                   process of augmenting software artifacts with their
                   semantic representations is still an open issue.
                   Indeed, exiting techniques to learn ontologies that
                   describe the domain of a certain software project
                   either 1) explore only one information source
                   associated to this project or 2) employ supervised
                   and domain specific techniques. In this paper we
                   present an ontology learning approach that 1)
                   exploits a range of information sources associated
                   with software projects and 2) relies on techniques

  abstract =      {The evaluation of the quality of ontological
                   classification is an important part of semantic web
                   technology. Because this area is under constant
                   development, it requires improvement and
                   standardisation. This paper discusses existing
                   evaluation metrics, and proposes a new method for
                   evaluating the ontology population task, which is
                   general enough to be used in a variety of situations,
                   yet more precise than many current metrics. The paper
                   further describes our first efforts in
                   operationalising the evaluation procedure, including
                   the creation of a semantically annotated corpus that
                   will function as a test bed for the proposed
                   evaluation mechanism, and comparison of different
                   evaluation metrics. We conclude that for
                   ontology-based evaluation, a more complex mechanism
                   than is traditionally used is preferable. This
                   mechanism aims to drive a benchmarking assessment
                   tool for the current state-of-the-art of ontology
                   population, and to set a standard for best practice
                   for future evaluation of human language technology
                   for the semantic web.},

                   the Semantic Web and Knowledge Management research,
                   ontologies have become more in demand in Natural
                   Language Processing. An increasing number of systems
                   use ontologies either internally, for modelling the
                   domain of the application, or as data structures that
                   hold the output resulting from the work of the
                   system, in the form of knowledge bases. While there
                   are many ontology editing tools aimed at expert
                   users, there are very few which are accessible to
                   users wishing to create simple structures without
                   delving into the intricacies of knowledge
                   representation languages. The approach described in
                   this paper allows users to create and edit ontologies
                   simply by using a restricted version of the English
                   language. The controlled language described within is
                   based on an open vocabulary and a restricted set of
                   grammatical constructs. Sentences written in this
                   language unambiguously map into a number of knowledge
                   representation formats including OWL and RDF-S to
                   allow round-trip ontology management},

                   class, entity role, semantic representation of
                   sentence and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the
                   features on the performance is investigated, as is
                   the impact of the relation classification hierarchy.
                   The results show there is a trade-off among these
                   factors for relation extraction and the features
                   containing more information such as semantic ones can

                   This paper presents the ANNIC system, which can index

                   linguististic annotations and features. It also
                   enables users to formulate versatile queries mixing
                   keywords and linguistic information. The result
                   consists of the matching texts in the corpus,
                   displayed within the context of linguistic
                   annotations (not just text, as is customary for KWIC
                   systems). The data is displayed in a graphical user

  abstract =      {The classification problem derived frominformation
                   extraction (IE) has an imbalanced training set. This
                   is particularly true when learning from smaller
                   datasets which often have a few positive training
                   examples and many negative ones. This paper takes two
                   popular IE algorithms SVM and Perceptron and
                   demonstrates how the introduction of an uneven
                   margins parameter can improve the results on
                   imbalanced training data in IE. Our experiments
                   demonstrate that the uneven margin was indeed
                   helpful, especially when learning from few examples.
                   Essentially, the smaller the training set is, the
                   more beneficial the uneven margin can be. We also
                   compare our systems to other state-of-theart
                   algorithms on several benchmarking corpora for IE.},

                   low-overhead systems development (GATE, a General
                   Architecture for Text Engineering). To verify our

                   multi-purpose cross-genre Named Entity recognition
                   system. This system aims be robust across diverse
                   input types, and to reduce the need for costly and
                   time-consuming adaptation of systems to new

                   evaluating ontology-based annotation tools, a key
                   component in text mining applications for the
                   Semantic Web. Semantic annotation and ontologybased
                   information extraction technologies form the
                   cornerstone of such applications. There has been a
                   great deal of work in the last decade on evaluating
                   traditional information extraction (IE) systems in
                   terms of performance, but such methods are not
                   sufficient for ontology-based systems. Furthermore,
                   usability aspects need to be considered such as
                   scalability, accessibility and interoperability. We
                   outline the main requirements in terms of both
                   usability and performance, proposing possible
                   solutions and using examples of existing tools and
