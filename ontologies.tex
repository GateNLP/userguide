GATE provides an API for modeling and manipulating ontologies and 
comes with two plugins that provide implementations for the API  
and several tools for simple editing of ontologies and using them for document annotation.
Note that for more complex ontology editing, it may be better to use a tool such as Protégé to first edit the ontology outside GATE.



Ontologies in GATE are classified as language resources. In order to create 
an ontology language resource, the user must first  
\emph{load a plugin containing an ontology implementation}.

The following implementations and ontology related tools are provided 
as plugins:
\begin{itemize}
% \item Plugin \texttt{Ontology\_OWLIM2} provides an implementation that is fully
%backwards-compatible with the implementation that was part of GATE 
%prior to version 5.1 (see Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:pluginowlim2compat}). 
\item Plugin \texttt{Ontology} provides the standard implementation of the GATE
ontology API (see Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:pluginontology}).
Unless noted otherwise, all information in this \chapthing\ applies to this
implementation.
\item The plugin \texttt{ontology-tools} provides a simple graphical ontology 
editor (see Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:vr}) and OCAT, a tool for interactive ontology based
document annotation (see Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ocat}). It also provides a gazetteer
processing resource, OntoGaz, that allows the mapping of linear 
gazetteers to classes in an ontology (see Section~\ref{sec:gazetteers:ontogaz}).
\item Plugin \texttt{gazetteer-ontology-based} provides the `Onto Root
Gazetteer' for the automatic creating of a gazetteer from an ontology 
(see Section~\ref{sec:gazetteers:ontoRootGaz})
\item Plugin \texttt{ontology-bdm-computation} can be used to compute BDM
scores (see Section~\ref{sec:eval:bdmplugin}).
\item Plugin \texttt{gazetteer-lkb} provides a processing resource for
creating annotations based on the contents of a large ontology.
\end{itemize}

GATE ontology support aims to simplify the use of ontologies both 
within the set of GATE tools and for programmers using the GATE ontology
API. The GATE ontology API hides the details of the actual backend
implementation and allows a simplified manipulation of 
ontologies by modeling ontology resources as easy-to-use Java objects.
Ontologies can be loaded from and saved to various serialization 
formats. 

The GATE ontology support roughly conforms to the representation, 
manipulation and inference that conforms to what is supported in
OWL-Lite (see~\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/}).
This means that a user can represent information in an ontology that
conforms to OWL-Lite and that the GATE ontology model will provide
inferred information equivalent to what an OWL-Lite reasoner 
would provide. The GATE ontology model makes an attempt to also
to some extend provide useful information for ontologies that do
not conform to OWL-Lite: RDFS, OWL-DL, OWL-Full or OWL2 ontologies
can be loaded but GATE might ignore part of all contents of
those ontologies, or might only provide part of, or incorrect 
inferred facts for such ontologies. If an ontology is loaded that 
contains a restriction not supported by OWL-Lite, like \texttt{oneOf},
\texttt{unionOf}, \texttt{intersectionOf}, or \texttt{complementOf},
the classes to which such restrictions apply will not be found in 
some sitations because the Ontology API has not way of representing
such restrictions. For example, such classes will not show up when
requesting the direct subclasses of a given class. In other situations,
e.g. when retrieved directly using the URI, the class will be found.
Using the Ontology plugin with ontologies that do not conform to 
OWL-Lite should be avoided to avoid such confusing behavior.

The GATE API tries to prevent clients from modifying an ontology
that conforms to OWL-Lite to become OWL-DL or OWL-Full and also
tries to prevent or warn about some of the most common errors that
would make the ontology inconsistent. However, the current implementation
is not able to prevent all such errors and has no way of finding out
if an ontology conforms to OWL-Lite or is inconsistent.

\sect{Data Model for Ontologies}


\subsect{Hierarchies of Classes and Restrictions}

Class hierarchy (or taxonomy) plays the central role in the ontology data model. This consists of a set of ontology classes 
(represented by \verb!OClass! objects in the ontology API)
linked by \texttt{subClassOf},
\texttt{superClassOf} and \texttt{equivalentClassAs} relations. Each ontology class 
is identified by an URI 
(unless it is a restriction or an anonymous class, see below).
The URI of each ontology resource must be unique.

Each class can have a set of superclasses and a set of subclasses;
these are used to build the class hierarchy. The \texttt{subClassOf} and
\texttt{superClassOf} relations are transitive and methods are provided by the
API for calculating the transitive closure for each of these relations
given a class. The transitive closure for the set of superclasses for
a given class is a set containing all the superclasses of that class,
as well as all the superclasses of its direct superclasses, and so on
until no more are found. This calculation is finite, the upper bound
being the set of all the classes in the ontology. A class that has no
superclasses is called a \emph{top class}. An ontology can have several top
classes. Although the GATE ontology API can deal with cycles
in the hierarchy graph, these can cause problems for processes using
the API and probably indicate an error in the definition of the
ontology. Also other components of GATE, like the ontology editor 
cannot deal with cyclic class structures and will terminate with an 
error. Care should be taken to avoid such situations.

A pair of ontology classes can also have an \texttt{equivalentClassAs} relation, 
which indicates that the two
classes are virtually the same and all their properties and instances
should be shared.

A restriction (represented by \verb!Restriction! objects in the GATE
ontology API) is an anonymous class (i.e., the class is not identified by
an URI/IRI) and is set on an object or a
datatype property to restrict some instances of the specified domain
of the property to have only certain values (also known as value
constraint) or certain number of values (also known as cardinality
restriction) for the property. Thus for each restriction there exists
at least three triples in the repository. One that defines resource as
a restriction, another one that indicates on which property the
restriction is specified, and finally the third one that indicates what
is the constraint set on the cardinality or value on the property.
There are six types of restrictions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Cardinality} Restriction (\verb!owl:cardinalityRestriction!): the only valid values for this restriction in OWL-Lite are 0 and 1. A cardinality restriction set to either 0 or 1 implies both a \emph{MinCardinality} Restriction and a \emph{MaxCardinality} Restriction
 set to the same value. 
\item \emph{MinCardinality} Restriction (\verb!owl:minCardinalityRestriction!)
\item \emph{MaxCardinality} Restriction (\verb!owl:maxCardinalityRestriction!)
\item \emph{HasValue} Restriction (\verb!owl:hasValueRestriction!)
\item \emph{AllValuesFrom} Restriction (\verb!owl:allValuesFromRestriction!)
\item \emph{SomeValuesFrom} Restriction (\verb!owl:someValuesFromRestriction!)
\end{enumerate}

Please visit the \htlink{http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/}{OWL Reference} for more
detailed information on restrictions.


\subsect{Instances}

Instances, also often called \emph{individuals} are objects that belong 
to classes. Like named classes, each
instance is identified by an URI. Each instance can belong to one or more
classes and can have properties with values. 
Two instances can  have the \texttt{sameInstanceAs} relation, which
indicates that the property values assigned to both instances should
be shared and that all the properties applicable to one instance are
also valid for the other. In addition, there is a \texttt{differentInstanceAs}
relation, which declares the instances as disjoint.

Instances are represented by \texttt{OInstance} objects in the API.
API methods are provided
for getting all the instances in an ontology, all the ones that belong to
a given class, and all the property values for a given instance. There
is also a method to retrieve a list of classes that the instance
belongs to, using either transitive or direct closure. 


\subsect{Hierarchies of Properties}

The last part of the data model is made up of hierarchies of
properties that can be associated with objects in the ontology. 
%Unlike
%some other representation models, in GATE, properties do not `belong'
%to ontology classes and they are instead first-class citizens of the data
%model. 
The specification of the type of objects that properties apply
to is done through the means of domains. Similarly, the types of
values that a property can take are restricted through the definition
of a range. A property with a domain that is an empty set can apply to
instances of any type (i.e. there are no restrictions given). Like
classes, properties can also have \texttt{superPropertyOf}, \texttt{subPropertyOf} and
\texttt{equivalentPropertyAs} relations among them.

GATE supports the following property types:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Annotation Property:}

An annotation property is associated with an ontology resource (i.e.~a
class, property or instance) and can have a \emph{Literal} as
value. A Literal is a Java object that can refer to the URI of any
ontology resource or a string
(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\#string) with the specified language
or a data type (discussed below) with a compatible value. Two
annotation properties can \emph{not} be declared as equivalent. It is also not
possible to specify a domain or range for an annotation property or a
super or subproperty relation between two annotation properties. Five
annotation properties, predefined by OWL, are made available to the user
whenever a new ontology instance is created: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item owl:versionInfo,
 \item rdfs:label,
 \item rdfs:comment,
 \item rdfs:seeAlso, and 
  \item rdfs:isDefinedBy. 
\end{itemize}
In other
words, even when the user creates an empty ontology, these annotation
properties are created automatically and available to users.

\item \textbf{Datatype Property:}

A datatype property is associated with an ontology instance and can
have a Literal value that is compatible with its data type . 
A data type can be one of
the pre-defined data types in the GATE ontology API:

\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#byte
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#duration
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#long
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#negativeInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonNegativeInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonPositiveInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#positiveInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#short
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#time
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedByte
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedInt
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedLong
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedShort
\end{verbatim}\end{small}

A set of ontology classes can be specified as a property's domain; in that case the
property can be associated with the instance belonging to all of the classes
specified in that domain only (the intersection of the set of domain classes).

Datatype properties can have other datatype properties as subproperties.

\item \textbf{Object Property:}

An object property is associated with an ontology instance and has an instance as
value. A set of ontology classes can be specified as property's domain and
range. Then the property can only be associated with the instances belonging to all
of the classes specified as the domain. Similarly, only the instances that
belong to all the classes specified in the range can be set as values. %Symmetric
%and Transitive properties are the two subtypes of Object properties.  
%A symmetric property's domain and range are the same.

Object properties can have other object properties as subproperties.

\item \textbf{RDF Property:}

RDF properties are more general than datatype or object properties. 
The GATE ontology API uses \texttt{RDFProperty} objects to hold
datatype properties, object properties, annotation properties or
actual RDF properties (\texttt{rdf:Property}). 

\textbf{Note:} The use of RDFProperty objects for creating, or manipulating RDF properties is carried over from previous
implementations for compatibility reasons but should be avoided.

\end{enumerate}

All properties (except the annotation properties) can be marked as functional
properties, which means that for a given instance in their domain, they can only
take at most one value, i.e. they define a function in the algebraic sense.
Properties inverse to functional properties are marked as \emph{inverse functional}. If
one likes ontology properties with algebraic relations, the semantics of these
become apparent.


\subsect{URIs}

URIs are used to identify resources (instances, classes, properties)
in an ontology. All URIs that identify classes, instances, or 
properties in an ontology must consist of two parts: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item a name part: this is the part after the last slash (\verb!/!) or the
first hash (\verb!#!) in the URI. This part of the URI is often used 
as a shorthand name for the entity (e.g. in the ontology editor)
and is often called a \emph{fragment identifier}
 \item a namespace part: the part that precedes the name, including the
trailing slash or hash character.
\end{itemize}
URIs uniquely identify resources: each resource can have at most one 
URI and each URI can be associated with at most one resource.

URIs are represented by OURI objects in the API. The Ontology object provides
factory methods to create OURIs from a complete URI string or by appending a
name to the default namespace of the ontology.  However it is the
responsibility of the caller to ensure that any strings that are passed to
these factory methods do in fact represent valid URIs.  GATE provides some
helper methods in the {\tt OUtils} class to help with encoding and decoding URI
strings.

%% TODO: more on URIs vs. IRIs, validation, translation stuff

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Ontology Event Model}
An Ontology Event Model (OEM) is implemented and incorporated into the
new GATE ontology API. Under the new OEM, events are fired
when a resource is added, modified or deleted from the ontology.

An interface called \texttt{OntologyModificationListener} is created with five methods
(see below) that need to be implemented by the listeners of ontology events.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public void resourcesRemoved(Ontology ontology, String[] resources);
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
This method is invoked whenever an ontology resource (a class, property
or instance) is removed from the ontology. Deleting one resource can also
result into the deletion of the other dependent resources. For example, deleting a
class should also delete all its instances (more details on how deletion works
are explained later). The second parameter, an array of strings, provides a list
of URIs of resources deleted from the ontology.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public void resourceAdded(Ontology ontology, OResource resource);
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
This method is invoked whenever a new resource is added to the ontology. The
parameters provide references to the ontology and the resource being added to it.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public void ontologyRelationChanged(Ontology ontology, OResource resource1, 
                                   OResource resource2, int eventType);
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
This method is invoked whenever a relation between two resources (e.g. OClass and 
OClass, RDFPRoeprty, RDFProeprty, etc) is changed. Example events are addition
or removal of a subclass or a subproperty, two classes or properties being set as
equivalent or different and two instances being set as same or different. The first parameter
is the reference to the ontology, the next two parameters are the resources being affected and
the final parameters is the event type. Please refer to the list of events specified below for
different types of events.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public void resourcePropertyValueChanged(Ontology ontology, 
                                         OResource resource, RDFProperty
                                       property, Object value, int eventType)
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
This method is invoked whenever any property value is added or removed to a resource.
The first parameter provides a reference to the ontology in which the event took
place. The second provides a reference to the resource affected, the third parameter provides
a reference to the property for which the value is added or removed, the fourth parameter is
the actual value being set on the resource and the fifth parameter identifies the type of event.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public void ontologyReset(Ontology ontology)
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
This method is called whenever ontology is reset.  In other words when all resources of the 
ontology are deleted using the ontology.cleanup method.

The \texttt{OConstants} class defines the static constants, listed below, for various event types.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
public static final int OCLASS_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int ANONYMOUS_CLASS_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int CARDINALITY_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int MIN_CARDINALITY_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int MAX_CARDINALITY_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int HAS_VALUE_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int SOME_VALUES_FROM_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int ALL_VALUES_FROM_RESTRICTION_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int SUB_CLASS_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int SUB_CLASS_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int EQUIVALENT_CLASS_EVENT;
public static final int ANNOTATION_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int DATATYPE_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int OBJECT_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int TRANSTIVE_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int SYMMETRIC_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int ANNOTATION_PROPERTY_VALUE_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int DATATYPE_PROPERTY_VALUE_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int OBJECT_PROPERTY_VALUE_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int RDF_PROPERTY_VALUE_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int ANNOTATION_PROPERTY_VALUE_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int DATATYPE_PROPERTY_VALUE_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int OBJECT_PROPERTY_VALUE_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int RDF_PROPERTY_VALUE_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int EQUIVALENT_PROPERTY_EVENT;
public static final int OINSTANCE_ADDED_EVENT;  
public static final int DIFFERENT_INSTANCE_EVENT;
public static final int SAME_INSTANCE_EVENT;
public static final int RESOURCE_REMOVED_EVENT;
public static final int RESTRICTION_ON_PROPERTY_VALUE_CHANGED;
public static final int SUB_PROPERTY_ADDED_EVENT;
public static final int SUB_PROPERTY_REMOVED_EVENT;
\end{verbatim}\end{small}

An ontology is responsible for firing various ontology events. Object wishing to
listen to the ontology events must implement the methods above and must be
registered with the ontology using the following method.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
addOntologyModificationListener(OntologyModificationListener oml);
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
The following method cancels the registration.
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
removeOntologyModificationListener(OntologyModificationListener oml);
\end{verbatim}\end{small}

\subsect{What Happens when a Resource is Deleted?}

Resources in an ontology are connected with each other. For example,
one class can be a sub or superclass of another classes. A resource can
have multiple properties attached to it. Taking these various
relations into account, change in one resource can affect other
resources in the ontology. Below we describe what happens (in terms
of what does the GATE ontology API do) when a resource is
deleted.
\begin{itemize}
\item When a class is deleted
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of all its super classes is obtained. For each class in this list,
a list of its subclasses is obtained and the deleted class is removed from it.
\item All subclasses of the deleted class are removed from the ontology. A list
of all its equivalent classes is obtained. For each class in this list, a list
of its equivalent classes is obtained and the deleted class is removed from it.
\item All instances of the deleted class are removed from the ontology.
\item All properties are checked to see if they contain the deleted class as a
member of their domain or range. If so, the respective property is also deleted
from the ontology.
\end{itemize}
\item When an instance is deleted
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of all its same instances is obtained. For each instance in this
list, a list of its same instances is obtained and the deleted instance is
removed.
\item A list of all instances set as different from the deleted instance is
obtained. For each instance in this list, a list of instances set as different
from it is obtained and the deleted instance is removed.
\item All the instances of ontology are checked to see if any of their set
properties have the deleted instance as value. If so, the respective set
property is altered to remove the deleted instance.
\end{itemize}
\item When a property is deleted
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of all its super properties is obtained. For each property in this
list, a list of its sub properties is obtained and the deleted property is
removed.
\item All sub properties of the deleted property are removed from the ontology. 
\item A list of all its equivalent properties is obtained. For each property in
this list, a list of its equivalent properties is obtained and the deleted
property is removed.
\item All instances and resources of the ontology are checked to see if they
have the deleted property set on them. If so the respective property is
deleted.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\sect[sec:ontologies:pluginontology]{The Ontology Plugin}

The plugin \texttt{Ontology} contains the current ontology API implementation.
It is based on a backend that uses Sesame version 2 and OWLIM version 3. 

The Ontology plugin depends on libraries that are not available in the Central
Maven Repository, so the plugin must be downloaded and installed separately.
You can download released versions of the plugin from
\htlink{https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-Ontology/releases}{GitHub}, and
snapshot versions from
\htlink{https://jenkins.gate.ac.uk/job/gate-plugins/job/gateplugin-Ontology/job/master/}{our
Jenkins continuous integration server}.  Unpacking the downloaded zip file will
create a new directory \texttt{gateplugin-Ontology-\emph{version}}, and that
directory should be loaded as a CREOLE plugin -- open the plugin manager, click
the ``+'' button at the top left, switch to the ``directory URL'' tab, and
select the ontology plugin directory you just unpacked.  This will add the
plugin to the known plugins list and you can then select ``load now'' and/or
``load always'' as appropriate.

Once the plugin is loaded, the context menu for Language Resources will
include the following ontology language resources:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{OWLIMOntology}: this is the standard language resource to use in most situations.
 It allows the user to create a new ontology backed by files in a local directory
 and optionally load ontology data into it.
 \item \emph{OWLIMOntology DEPRECATED}: this language resource has the same functionality 
 as \emph{OWLIMOntology} but uses the exactly same package and class name as the 
 language resource in the plugin \verb!Ontology_OWLIM2!. This LR is provided to 
 allow an easier upgrade of existing pipelines to the new implementation but
 users should move the the \emph{OWLIMOntology LR} as soon as possible.
 \item \emph{ConnectSesameOntology}: This language resources allows the use of ontologies
 that are already stored in a Sesame2 repository which is either stored in a 
 directory or accessible from a server. This is useful for quickly re-using a
 very large ontology that has been previously created as a persistent \emph{OWLIMOntology}
 language resource.
 \item \emph{CreateSesameOntology}: This language resource allows the user to create a 
 new empty ontology by specifying the repository configuration for creating 
 the sesame repository. \textbf{Note:}\emph{This is for advanced uses only!}
\end{itemize}

Each of these language resources is explained in more detail in the following sections.

To make the plugin available to your GATE Embedded application, load the plugin
prior to creating one of the ontology language resources using code similar to
the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
// Find the directory for the Ontology plugin
File ontologyPlugin = new File("/path/to/gateplugin-Ontology");
// Load the plugin from that directory
Gate.getCreoleRegister().registerPlugin(new Plugin.Directory(
      ontologyPlugin.toURI().toURL()));
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, if you load a saved application state that was saved with the
plugin loaded, then it will be re-loaded automatically as part of that process.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:upgrade]{Upgrading from previous versions of GATE}

If you have a saved GATE application from GATE version 8.4.1 or earlier that
uses the Ontology plugin that was built in to GATE at that time, you will need
to upgrade your application to make it work with GATE 8.5 and later.

With the Ontology plugin loaded, there will be an ``Ontologies'' sub-menu in
the GATE Developer ``Tools'' menu, with an entry to ``Upgrade old saved
application''.  Select this option and locate the existing xgapp file in the
file chooser.  The upgrade backs up the old xgapp file with a ``.onto.bak''
extension and replaces all references to the old ``built-in'' Ontology plugin
with the version of the plugin you currently have loaded.

\emph{Note} that this procedure is specific to the Ontology plugin and is in
addition to the standard upgrade procedure detailed in
section~\ref{sec:developer:convertxgapp} used for the other standard GATE
plugins -- to fully upgrade an application that uses ontologies you must run
both the standard upgrader \emph{and} the ontology plugin upgrader in sequence
in order to obtain a final xgapp that will work with GATE 8.5.  You can run the
two upgrades either way around on the same file, we suggest running the
standard upgrader first (skipping the Ontology plugin) and then the ontology
plugin upgrader second, which will leave your original pre-8.5 application
backed up with a ``.bak'' extension.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:owlim]{The OWLIMOntology Language Resource}

The \verb!OWLIMOntology! language resource is the main ontology language 
resource provided by the plugin and creates an in-memory store backed
by files in a directory on the file system to hold the ontology
data.

To create a new OWLIM Ontology resource, select `OWLIM Ontology' from
the right-click `New' menu for language resources. A dialog as 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ontology_lrowlim_new} appears with the following 
parameters to fill in or change:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Name} (optional): if no name is given, a default name will be generated, if an
  ontology is loaded from an URL, based on that URL, otherwise based on
  the language resource name.
 \item \emph{baseURI} (optional): the URI to be used for resolving relative URI references 
    in the ontology during loading.
 %% TODO: explain more automatic setting of default name space, ontology
 %% URI etc. once this has actually been properly implemented!
 \item \emph{dataDirectoryName} (optional): the name of an existing directory on the file 
   system where the directory will be created that backs the ontology store.
  The name of the directory that will be created within the data directory
  will be \verb!GATE_OWLIMOntology_! followed by a string representation
  of the system time. If this parameter is not specified, the value for 
  system property \texttt{java.io.tmpdir} is used, if this is not set either
  an error is raised.
 \item \emph{loadImports} (optional): either true or false. If set to false all ontology
 import specifications found in the loaded ontology are ignored. This
  parameter is ignored if no ontology is loaded when the language 
  resource is created. 
  \item \emph{mappingsURL} (optional): the URL of a text file containing import mappings 
  specifications. See section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:mappings} 
  for a description of the mappings file.
  If no URL is specified, the GATE will interpret each import URI found
  as an URL and try to import the data from that URL. If the URI is not absolute 
  it will get resolved against the base URI.
  \item \emph{persistent} (optional): true or false: if false, the directory created inside
  the data directory is removed when the language resource is closed, 
  otherwise, that directory is kept. The \verb!ConnectSesameOntology! language
  resource can be used at a later time to connect to such a directory and
  create an ontology language resource for it (see Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:connect}).
  \item \emph{rdfXmlUrl} (optional): an URL specifying the location of an ontology in
  RDF/XML serialization format (see \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/}) from which
  to load initial ontology data from. The parameter name can be changed
  from \texttt{rdfXmlUrl} to \texttt{n3Url} to indicate N3 serialization
  format (see \url{http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html}), 
  to \texttt{ntriplesUrl}  to indicate N-Triples format 
  (see \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-testcases-20040210/#ntriples}), 
  and to \texttt{turtleUrl} to indicate TURTLE serialization format
  (see \url{http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/}).
  If this is left blank, no ontology is loaded and an empty ontology
  language resource is created.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} you could create a language resource such as 
\emph{OWLIM Ontology} from GATE Developer successfully, but you 
will not be able to browse/edit the ontology unless you loaded 
\emph{Ontology Tools} plugin beforehand.

Additional ontology data can be loaded into an existing ontology
language resource by selecting the `Load' option from the 
language resource's context menu. This will show the 
dialog shown in figure~\ref{fig:ontology_lr_load}.
The parameters in this dialog correspond to the parameters in the 
dialog for creating a new ontology with the addition of one new
parameter: `load as import'. If this parameter is checked, the
ontology data is loaded specifically as an ontology import. Ontology
imports can be excluded from what is saved at a later time.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ontology_lr_save} shows the ontology save 
dialog that is shown when the option `Save as\dots' is selected from
the language resource's context menu. 
The parameter `include imports' allows the user to specify if the data 
that has been loaded through imports should be included in the saved data or not.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:connect]{The ConnectSesameOntology Language Resource}

This ontology language resource can be created from either 
a directory on the local file system that holds an ontology backing store
(as created in the `data directory' for the `OWLIM Ontology' language resource),
or from a sesame repository on a server that holds an OWLIM ontology 
store.

This is very useful when using very large ontologies with GATE. Loading a 
very large ontology from a serialized format takes a significant amount
of time because the file has to be deserialized and all implied facts
have to get generated. Once an ontology has been loaded into a persisting
\texttt{OWLIMOntology} language resource, the \texttt{ConnectSesameOntology} language resource can
be used with the directory created to re-connect to the already de-serialized
and inferred data much faster.

Figure~\ref{fig:ontology_lrconn_new} shows the dialog for creating a
\texttt{ConnectSesameOntology} language resource.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{repositoryID}: the name of the sesame repository holding the ontology store.
 For a backing store created with the `OWLIM Ontology' language resource, this
 is always `owlim3'. 
 \item \emph{repositoryLocation}: the URL of the location where to find the repository
 holding the ontology store. The URL can either specify a local directory or 
 an HTTP server. For a backing store created with the `OWLIM Ontology'
 language resource this is the directory that was created inside the data directory
 (the name of the directory starting with \verb!GATE_OWLIMOntology_!). 
 If the URL specifies a HTTP server which requires authentification, the user-ID
 and password have to be included in the URL (e.g. \verb!http://userid:passwd@localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame!).

\end{itemize}

Note that this ontology language resource is only supported when connected with
an OWLIM3 repository configured to use the \texttt{owl-max ruleset} and with
\texttt{partialRDFS} optimizations disabled! Connecting to any other repository
is experimental and for expert users only! Also note that connecting to a
repository that is already in use by GATE or any other application is not
supported and might result in unwanted or erroneous behavior!

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:create]{The CreateSesameOntology Language Resource}

This ontology language resource can be directly created from a Sesame2
repository configuration file. This is an experimental language resource 
intended for expert users only. This can be used to create any kind 
of Sesame2 repository, but the only repository configuration supported 
by GATE and the GATE ontology API is an OWLIM repository configured to use 
the \texttt{owl-max ruleset} and with \texttt{partialRDFS} optimizations
disabled.  The dialog for creating this language resource is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ontology_lrcreate_new}.

\end{figure}

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:owlim2compat]{The OWLIM2 Backwards-Compatible Language Resource}

This language resource is shown as ``OWLIM Ontology DEPRECATED'' in the `New
Language Resource' submenu from the `File' menu. It provides the
``OWLIM Ontology'' language resource in
a way that attempts maximum backwards-compatibility with the ontology language
resource provided by prior versions or the \texttt{Ontology\_OWLIM2} 
language resource. This means, the class name is identical to those
language resources {\texttt{gate.creole.ontology.owlim.OWLIMOntologyLR}) and
the parameters are made compatible. This means that the parameter
\texttt{defaultNameSpace} is added as an alias for the parameter
\texttt{baseURI} (also the methods \texttt{setPersistsLocation} and 
\texttt{getPersistLocation} are available for legacy Java code that expects
them, but the persist location set that way is not actually used).

In addition, this language resource will still automatically add the resource
name of a resource as the String value for the annotation property ``label''.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:mappings]{Using Ontology Import Mappings}

If an ontology is loaded that contains the URIs of imported ontologies
using \texttt{owl:imports}, the plugin will try to automatically resolve
those URIs to URLs and load the ontology file to be imported from the location
corresponding to the URL. 
This is done transitively, i.e. import specifications contained in freshly
imported ontologies are resolved too.

In some cases one might want to suppress the import of certain ontologies or
one might want to load the data from a different locatin, e.g. from a file
on the local file system instead. With the OWLIMOntology language resource
this can be achieved by specifying an import mappings file when creating 
the ontology.

An import mappings file (see figure~\ref{fig:importmappingsfile} for an example)
is a plain file that maps specific import URIs to 
URLs or to nothing at all. Each line that is not empty or does not start 
with a hash (\verb|#|) indicating a comment line must contain a URI.
If the URI is not followed by anything, this URI will be ignored when 
processing imports. If the URI is followed by something, this is interpreted
as a URL that is used for resolving the import of the URI. Local files
can be specified as \texttt{file:} URLs or by just giving the absolute
or relative pathname of the file in Linux path notation (forward slashes
as path separators). At the moment, filenames with embedded whitespace
are not supported. If a pathname is relative it will be resolved relative
to the directory which contains the mappings file.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:bigowlim]{Using BigOWLIM}

The GATE ontology plugin is based on SwiftOWLIM for storing the
ontology and managing inference. SwiftOWLIM is an in-memory store
and the maximum size of ontologies that can be stored is limited
by the available memory.

BigOWLIM (see \url{http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/big/}) 
can handle huge ontologies and is not limited
by available memory. BigOWLIM is a commercial product and needs
to be separately obtained and installed for use with the GATE
ontology plugin. See the BigOWLIM installation guide on how to 
set up BigOWLIM on a Tomcat server and how to create BigOWLIM on 
the server with the Sesame console program.

The ontology plugin can easily and without any additional installation
 be used with BigOWLIM repositories by
using the ConnectSesameOntology LR (see section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:connect})
to connect to a BigOWLIM repository on a remote Tomcat server. 

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ontoplugin:sesamecli]{The sesameCLI command line interface}

The script \texttt{sesameCLI} is located in the \texttt{bin} subdirectory
of the Ontology plugin directory and provides basic functionality for 
creating repositories, importing, exporting, querying and updating of GATE 
ontologies, either on a saved local file repository (saved with the persistent
  parameter of the OWLIM Ontology LR set to \texttt{true}) or a repository on a 
server from the command line. It can be used on any machine that supports 
bash scripts.

To show usage information run the command with the \texttt{--help} option. Some
options can be specified in a long form using double hyphens or a single-letter 
form using a single hyphen, for example, \texttt{-e} can be used in place of
\texttt{--do} or \texttt{-u} in place of \texttt{--serverURL}.

The main option is \texttt{--do} which specifies which action should be carried
out. For all actions the ontology must be specified as a combination of 
either the URL of a Sesame web server with \texttt{serverURL} or the 
directory of a local Sesame repository directory with \texttt{sesameDir} and the name 
of the repository with \texttt{--id}.

The \texttt{--do} option supports the following values:
\begin{description}
 \item [clear] Clear the repository and remove all triples from it.
 \item [ask] Perform an ASK query. The result of the ASK query is printed to standard output.
 \item [query] Perform a SELECT query. The result of the query is printed in tabular form to
   standard output. The default column separation character is a tab and  
   if the column separator or a new line character occurs in a value it is changed to 
   a space.
 \item [update] Perform a SPARQL update query (INSERT, DELETE)
 \item [import] Import data into the repository from a file
 \item [export] Export data from the repository into a filenames
 \item [create] Create a new repository using a TURTLE repository configuration file.
 \item [delete] Delete a repository. Note that due to a Sesame limitation, the actual
   files for the repository may not be removed from the disk for remote ontologies
   on a server.
 \item [listids] Print the list of all repository names to standard output.
\end{description}


The \texttt{sesameCLI} command line tool is meant as an easy way to perform
some basic operations from the command line and for basic testing. The functions
it supports and its command line options may change in future versions.

%\sect[sec:ontologies:pluginowlim2compat]
% {The Ontology\_OWLIM2 plugin: backwards-compatible implementation}
%
%
%\subsect[sec:ontologies:lr]{The OWLIMOntologyLR Language Resource}
%
%This implementation is identical to the implementation that was part of 
%GATE core before version 5.1. It is based on SwiftOWLIM version 2 and 
%Sesame version 1.
%
%In order to load an ontology in an OWLIM repository, the user has to provide certain
%configuration parameters.  These include the name of the repository, the URL of the
%ontology, the default name space, the format of the ontology (RDF/XML, N3, NTriples and
%Turtle), the URLs or absolute locations of the other ontologies to be imported,
%their respective name spaces and so on. Ontology files, based on their format,
%are parsed and persisted in the NTriples format.
%
%In order to utilize the power of OWLIM and the simplicity of GATE
%ontology API, GATE provides an implementation of the OWLIM
%Ontology. Its basic purpose is to hide all the complexities of OWLIM
%and Sesame and provide an easy to use API and interface to create,
%load, save and update ontologies. Based on certain parameters that
%the user provides when instantiating the ontology, a configuration
%file is dynamically generated to create a dummy repository in memory
%(unless persistence is specified).
%
%When creating a new ontology, one can use an existing file to pre-populate it
%with data. If no such file is provided, an empty ontology is created. A detailed
%description for all the parameters that are available for new ontologies
%follows:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \emph{defaultNameSpace} is the base URI to be used for all new items that
%are only mentioned using their local name.  This can safely be left empty, in
%which case, while adding new resources to the ontology, users are asked to
%provide name spaces for each new resource.
%\item As indicated earlier, OWLIM supports four different formats: RDF/XML,
%NTriples, Turtle and N3.  According to the format of the ontology file, user should
%select one of the four URL options \emph{(rdfXmlURL, ntriplesURL, turtleURL and
%n3URL (not supported yet))} and provide a URL pointing to the
%ontology data.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Once an ontology is created, additional data can be loaded that will
%be merged with the existing information. This can be done by
%right-clicking on the ontology in the resources tree in GATE Developer
%and selecting `Load ... data' where `...' is one of the supported
%formats.
%
%Other options available are cleaning the ontology (deleting all the information from
%it) and saving it to a file in one of the supported formats.
% 
%%% This was originally part of the editor section but really belongs to the LR section
%
%Ontology can be saved in different formats (rdf/xml, ntriples, n3 and
%turtle) using the options provided in the context menu that can be
%invoked by right clicking on the instance of an ontology in GATE
%Developer. All the changes made to the ontology are logged and stored
%as an ontology feature. Users can also export these changes to a file
%by selecting the `Save Ontology Event Log' option from the context
%menu. Similarly, users can also load the exported event log and apply
%the changes on a different ontology by using the `Load Ontology Event
%Log' option. Any change made to the ontology can be described by a set
%of triples either added or deleted from the repository. For example,
%in GATE Embedded, addition of a new instance results into addition of
%two statements into the repository:
%
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
%
%// Adding a new instance "Rec1" of type "Recognized"
%// Here + indicates the addition

%The event log therefore contains a list of such triples, the latest change being at

\sect[sec:ontologies:vr]{GATE Ontology Editor}


GATE's ontology support also includes a viewer/editor that can be used
within GATE Developer to navigate an ontology and quickly inspect the
information relating to any of the objects defined in it---classes and
restrictions, instances and their properties. Also, resources can be
deleted and new resources can be added through the viewer.

The ontology viewer is part of the ``Ontology Tools'' plugin, which is visible
by default in the GATE plugin manager, however you will also need to load the
ontology implementation plugin (see
section~\ref{sec:ontologies:pluginontology}) in order to be able to load the
ontology LRs you want to view.

\texttt{Note:} To make it possible to show a loaded ontology in the ontology
editor, the Ontology Tools plugin must be loaded
\emph{before} the ontology language resource is created.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ontology-vr.png}
\caption{The GATE Ontology Viewer}
\label{fig:ontology-vr}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The viewer is divided into two areas. One on the left shows separate tabs for
hierarchy of classes and instances and for (as of Gate 4) hierarchy of
properties. The view on right hand side shows the details pertaining of the
object currently selected in the other two.

First tab on the left view displays a tree which shows all the classes and
restrictions defined in the ontology. The tree can have several root
nodes---one for each top class in the ontology. The same tree also shows each
instances for each class. \textbf{Note}: Instances that belong to several classes are shown as children
of all the classes they belong to.

Second tab on the left view displays a tree of all the properties defined in the
ontology. This tree can also have several root nodes---one for each top property
in the ontology.  Different types of properties are distinguished by using
different icons.

Whenever an item is selected in the tree view, the right-hand view is populated with
the details that are appropriate for the selected object. For an ontology class, the
details include the brief information about the resource such as the URI of the
selected class, type of the selected class etc., set of direct superclasses, the
set of all superclasses using the transitive closure, the set of direct
subclasses, the set of all the subclasses, the set of equivalent classes, the
set of applicable property types, the set of property values set on the selected
class, and the set of instances that belong to the selected class. For a
restriction, in addition to the above information, it displays on which
property the restriction is applicable to and  what type of the restriction
that is.

For an instance, the details displayed include the brief information about the
instance, set of direct types (the list of classes this instance is known to
belong to), the set of all types this instance belongs to (through the
transitive closure of the set of direct types), the set of same instances, the
set of different instances and the values for all the properties that are set.

When a property is selected, different information is displayed in the right-hand
view according to the property type. It includes the brief information about the
property itself, set of direct superproperties, the set of all superproperties
(obtained through the transitive closure), the set of direct subproperties, the
set of all subproperties (obtained through the transitive closure), the set of
equivalent properties, and domain and range information.

As mentioned in the description of the data model, properties are not directly
linked to the classes, but rather define their domain of applicability through a
set of domain restrictions. This means that the list of properties should not
really be listed as a detail for class objects but only for instances. It is
however quite useful to have an indication of the types of properties that could
apply to instances of a given class. Because of the semantics of property
domains, it is not possible to calculate precisely the list of applicable
properties for a given class, but only an estimate of it. If a property for
instance requires its domain instances to belong to two different classes then
it cannot be known with certitude whether it is applicable to either of the two
classes---it does not apply to all instances of any of those classes, but only
to those instances the two classes have in common. Because of this, such
properties will not be listed as applicable to any class. 

The information listed in the details pane is organised in sub-lists according
to the type of the items. Each sub-list can be collapsed or expanded by
clicking on the little triangular button next to the title. The ontology viewer
is dynamic and will update the information displayed whenever the underlying
ontology is changed through the API.

When you double click on any resource in the details table, the respective
resource is selected in the class or in the property tree and the selected
resource's details are shown in the details table. To change a
property value, user can double click on a value of the property (second column)
and the relevant window is shown where user is asked to provide a new value.
Along with each property value, a button (with red X caption) is provided.
If user wants to remove a property value he or she can click on the button and
the property value is deleted.

A new toolbar has been added at the top of the ontology viewer, which contains
the following buttons to add and delete ontology resources:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add new top class (TC)
\item Add new subclass (SC)
\item Add new instance (I)
\item Add new restriction (R)
\item Add new Annotation property (A)
\item Add new Datatype property (D)
\item Add new Object property (O)
\item Add new Symmetric property (S)
\item Add new Transitive property (T)
\item Remove the selected resource(s) (X)
\item Search
\item Refresh ontology
\end{itemize}

The tree components allow the user to select more than one node, but
the details table on the right-hand side of the GATE Developer GUI
only shows the details of the first selected node. The buttons in the
toolbar are enabled and disabled based on users' selection of nodes in
the tree.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Creating a new top class:}

A window appears which asks the user to provide details for its namespace (default
name space if specified), and class name. If there is already a class with same
name in ontology, GATE Developer shows an appropriate message. 

\item \textbf{Creating a new subclass:}

A class can have multiple super classes.  Therefore, selecting multiple classes in
the ontology tree and then clicking on the `SC' button, automatically considers
the selected classes as the super classes.  The user is then asked for details for
its namespace and class name.

\item \textbf{Creating a new instance:}

An instance can belong to more than one class.  Therefore, selecting multiple
classes in the ontology tree and then clicking on the `I' button, automatically
considers the selected classes as the type of new instance.  The user is then
prompted to provide details such as namespace and instance name.

\item \textbf{Creating a new restriction:}

As described above, restriction is a type of an anonymous class and is specified
on a property with a constraint set on either the number of values it can take
or the type of value allowed for instances to have for that property.  User can
click on the blue `R' square button which shows a window for creating a new
restriction.  User can select a type of restriction, property and a value
constraint for the same.  Please note that restrictions are considered as
anonymous classes and therefore user does not have to specify any URI for the
same but restrictions are named automatically by the system.

\item \textbf{Creating a new property:}

Editor allows creating five different types of properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Annotation property: Since an annotation property cannot have any domain 
or range constraints, clicking on the new annotation property button brings up a
dialog that asks the user for information such as the namespace and the 
annotation property name.
\item Datatype property: A datatype property can have one or more ontology 
classes as its domain and one of the pre-defined datatypes as its range. 
Selecting one or more classes and clicking on the new Datatype property icon, 
brings up a window where the selected classes in the tree are taken as the 
property's domain. The user is then asked to provide information such as the 
namespace and the property name.  A drop down box allows users to select one of 
the data types from the list.
\item Object, Symmetric and Transitive properties:  These properties can have 
one or more classes as their domain and range.  For a symmetric property the 
domain and range are the same.  Clicking on any of these options brings up a 
window where user is asked to provide information such as the namespace and the 
property name.  The user is also given two buttons to select one or more classes
as values for domain and range.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Removing the selected resources:}

All the selected nodes are removed when user clicks on the `X' button.  Please
note that since ontology resources are related in various ways,
deleting a resource can affect other resources in the ontology;
for example, deleting a resource can cause other resources
in the same ontology to be deleted too.

\item \textbf{Searching in ontology:}

The Search button allows users to search for resources in the ontology. A window
pops up with an input text field that allows incremental searching.  In other 
words, as user types in name of the resource, the drop-down list refreshes itself
to contain only the resources that start with the typed string. Selecting one of
the resources in this list and pressing OK, selects the appropriate resource in 
the editor.  The Search function also allows selecting resources by the property
values set on them.

\item \textbf{Refresh Ontology}

The refresh button reloads the ontology and updates the editor.

\item \textbf{Setting properties on instances/classes:}

Right-clicking on an instance brings up a menu that provides a list of properties
that are inherited and applicable to its classes.  Selecting a specific
property from the menu allows the user to provide a value for that property. For
example, if the property is an Object property, a new window appears which
allows the user to select one or more instances which are compatible to the range
of the selected property.  The selected instances are then set as property
values.  For classes, all the properties (e.g.~annotation 
and RDF properties) are listed on the menu.

\item \textbf{Setting relations among resources:}

Two or more classes, or two or more properties, can be set as equivalent;
similarly two or more instances can be marked as the same. Right-clicking on a
resource brings up a menu with an appropriate option (Equivalent Class for
ontology classes, Same As Instance for instances and Equivalent Property for
properties) which when clicked then brings up a window with a drop down box
containing a list of resources that the user can select to specify them as
equivalent or the same.
\end{enumerate}

\sect[sec:ontologies:ocat]{Ontology Annotation Tool}

The Ontology Annotation Tool (OAT) is a GATE plugin available from
the Ontology Tools plugin set, which enables a user to manually annotate a text
with respect to one or more ontologies. The required ontology must be selected
from a pull-down list of available ontologies.

The OAT tool supports annotation with information about the ontology classes,
instances and properties.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ocat:view]{Viewing Annotated Text}

Ontology-based annotations in the text can be viewed by selecting the desired classes or instances in the ontology tree in GATE Developer 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:view}). By default, when a class is
selected, all of its sub-classes and instances are also automatically
selected and their mentions are highlighted in the text. There is an
option to disable this default behaviour (see
Section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ocat:options}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{ontology_ocat_view.png}
\caption{Viewing Ontology-Based Annotations} \label{fig:ocat:view}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:view} shows the mentions of each class and instance in a different
colour. These colours can be customised by the user by clicking on
the class/instance names in the ontology tree. It is also possible to expand
and collapse branches of the ontology.

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ocat:editing]{Editing Existing Annotations}

\begin{figure}

In order to view the class/instance of a highlighted annotation in the text
(e.g., United States - see Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:edit}), hover the mouse
over it and an edit dialogue will appear. It shows the current class or instance
(Country in our example) and allows the user to delete it or change
it. To delete an existing annotation, press the Delete button.

A class or instance can be changed by starting to type the name of the
new class in the combo-box. Then it displays a list of available
classes and instances, which start with the typed string. For example,
if we want to change the type from Country to Location, we can type
`Lo' and all classes and instances which names start with Lo will be
displayed. The more characters are typed, the fewer matching classes
remain in the list. As soon as one sees the desired class in the list,
it is chosen by clicking on it.

It is possible to apply the changes to all occurrences of the same
string and the same previous class/instance, not just to the current
one. This is useful when annotating long texts. The user needs to make
sure that they still check the classes and instances of annotations
further down in the text, in case the same string has a different
meaning (e.g., bank as a building vs. bank as a river bank).

The edit dialogue also allows correcting annotation offset boundaries.
In other words, user can expand or shrink the annotation offsets'
boundaries by clicking on the relevant arrow buttons.

OAT also allows users to assign property values as annotation features
to the existing class and instance annotations. In the case of class
annotation, all annotation properties from the ontology are displayed
in the table. In the case of instance annotations, all properties from
the ontology applicable to the selected instance are shown in the
table. The table also shows existing features of the selected
annotation. User can then add, delete or edit any value(s) of the
selected feature.  In the case of a property, user is allowed to
provide an arbitrary number of values. User can, by clicking on the
editList button, add, remove or edit any value to the property.  In
case of object properties, users are only allowed to select values
from a pre-selected list of values (i.e.  instances which satisfy the
selected property's range constraints).
 
\subsect[sec:ontologies:ocat:add]{Adding New Annotations}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{ontology_ocat_add-new.png}
\caption{Add New Annotation} \label{fig:ocat:add_new}
\end{figure}

New annotations can be added in two ways: using a dialogue (see
Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:add_new}) or by selecting the text and clicking on the
desired class or instance in the ontology tree.

When adding a new annotation using the dialogue, select a text and
after a very short while, if the mouse is not moved, a dialogue will
appear (see Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:add_new}). Start typing the name of
the desired class or instance, until you see it listed in the
combo-box, then select it with the mouse. This operation is the same,
as in changing the class/instance of an existing annotation. One has
the option of applying this choice to the current selection only or to
all mentions of the selected string in the current document (Apply to
All check box).

User can also create an instance from the selected text. If user
checks the `create instance' checkbox prior to selecting the class,
the selected text is annotated with the selected class and a new
instance of the selected class (with the name equivalent to the
selected text) is created (provided there isn't any existing instance
available in the ontology with that name).

\subsect[sec:ontologies:ocat:options]{Options}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{ontology_ocat_options.png}
\caption{Tool Options} \label{fig:ocat:options}
\end{figure}

There are several options that control the OAT behaviour (see
Figure~\ref{fig:ocat:options}):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Disable child feature}: By default, when a class is
selected, all of its sub-classes are also automatically selected and
their mentions are highlighted in the text. This option disables that
behaviour, so only mentions of the selected class are highlighted.

\item {\bf Delete confirmation}: By default, OAT deletes ontological
information without asking for confirmation, when the delete button
is pressed. However, if this leads to too many mistakes, it is
possible to enable delete confirmations from this option.

\item {\bf Disable Case-Sensitive Feature}: When user decides to annotate all
occurrences of the selected text (`apply to all' option) in the
document and if the `disable case-sensitive feature' is selected,
the tool, when searching for the identical strings in the document
text, ignores the case-sensitivity.

\item {\bf Setting up a filter to disable resources from the OAT GUI}: When
user wants to annotate the text of a document with certain
classes/instances of the ontology, s/he may disable the resources
which s/he is not going to use.  This option allows users to select a
file which contains class or instance names, one per line.  These
names are case sensitive.  After selecting a file, when user turns on
the `filter' check box, the resources specified in the filter file
are disabled and removed from the annotation editor window. User can
also add new resources to this list or remove some or all from the
list by right clicking on the respective resource and by selecting the
relevant option.  Once modified, the `save' button allows users to
export this list to a file.

\item {\bf Annotation Set}: GATE stores information in annotation
sets and OAT allows you to select which set to use as input and
output.

\item {\bf Annotation Type}: By default, this is annotation of type
Mention, but that can be changed to any other name. This option is
required because OAT uses Gate annotations to store and read the
ontological data. However, to do that, it needs a type (i.e. name) so
ontology-based annotations can be distinguished easily from other
annotations (e.g. tokens, gazetteer lookups).

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect[sec:ontologies:rat]{Relation Annotation Tool}

This tool is designed to annotate a document with ontology instances and to
create relations between annotations with ontology object properties. It is
close and compatible with OAT but focus on relations between annotations, see
section~\ref{sec:ontologies:ocat} for OAT.

To use it you must load the Ontology Tools plugin, load a document and an
ontology then show the document and in the document editor click on the
button named `RAT-C' (Relation Annotation Tool Class view) which will also
display the `RAT-I' view (Relation Annotation Tool Instance view).

\subsection{Description of the two views}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{relation-annotation-tool.png}
\caption{Relation Annotation Tool vertical and horizontal document views}
\label{fig:relation-annotation-tool-views}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The right vertical view shows the loaded ontologies as trees.

To show/hide the annotations in the document, use the class checkbox. The
selection of a class and the ticking of a checkbox are independent and work
the same as in the annotation sets view.

To change the annotation set used to load/save the annotations, use the drop
down list at the bottom of the vertical view.

To hide/show the classes in the tree in order to decrease the amount of
elements displayed, use the context menu on classes selection. The setting
is saved in the user preferences.

The bottom horizontal view shows two tables: one for instances and one for
properties. The instances table shows the instances and their labels for the
selected class in the ontology trees and the properties table shows the
properties values for the selected instance in the instances table.

Two buttons allow to add a new instance from the text selection in the
document or as a new label for the selected instance.

To filter on instance labels, use the filter text field. You can clear the
field with the X button at the end of the field.

You can use `Show In Ontology Editor' on the context menu of an instance in
the instance table. Then in the ontology editor you can add class or object
properties.

\subsection{Create new annotation and instance from text selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item select a class in the ontology tree at the right
\item select some text in the document editor and hover the mouse over it
\item use the button `New Inst.' in the view at the bottom
\item in the bottom left table you have your new instance
\item don't forget to save your document AND the ontology before to quit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create new annotation and add label to existing instance from text selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item select a class in the ontology tree at the right
\item select some text in the document editor and hover the mouse on it
\item if the instances table is empty then clear the filter text field
\item select an existing instance in the instances table
\item use the button `Add to Selected Inst.' in the view at the bottom
\item in the bottom left table you have your new label
\item don't forget to save your document AND the ontology before to quit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create and set properties for annotation relation}

\begin{itemize}
\item open an ontology with the ontology editor
\item if not existing add at least an object property for one class
\item set the domain and range accordingly to the type of annotation relation
\item add an instance or label as explained previously for the same class
\item in the bottom right table you have the properties for this instance
\item click in the `Value' column cell to set the object property
\item if the list of choices is empty, add first other instances
\item don't forget to save your document AND the ontology before to quit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delete instance, label or property}

\begin{itemize}
\item select one or more instances or properties in their respective table
\item right-click on the selection for the context menu and choose an item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Differences with OAT and Ontology Editor}

This tool is very close to OAT but without the annotation editor popup and
instead a bottom tables view, with multiple ontologies support, with only
instance annotation and no class annotation.

To make OAT compatible with this tool you must use `Mention' as annotation
type, `class' and `inst' as feature names. They are the defaults in OAT. You
must also select the same annotation set in the drop down list at the bottom
right corner.

You should enable the option `Selected Text As Property Value' in the
Options panel of OAT. So it will add a label from the selected text for each
instance.

The ontology editor is useful to check that an instance is correctly added
to the ontology and to add new annotation relation as object property.

\sect[sec:ontologies:ontology-aware-jape]{Ontology-Aware JAPE Transducer}

One of the GATE components that makes use of the ontology support is the JAPE
transducer (see \Chapthing~\ref{chap:jape}). Combining the power of ontologies
with JAPE's pattern matching mechanisms can ease the creation of applications.

In order to use ontologies with JAPE, one needs to load an ontology in GATE
before loading the JAPE transducer. Once the ontology is known to the system, it
can be set as the value for the optional {\tt ontology} parameter for the JAPE
grammar. Doing so alters slightly the way the matching occurs when the grammar
is executed. If a transducer is ontology-aware (i.e. it has a value set for the
'ontology' parameter) it will treat all occurrences of the feature named {\tt
class} differently from the other features of annotations.  The values for the
feature {\tt class} on any type of annotation will be considered as referring
to classes in the ontology as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the {\tt class} feature value is a valid URI (e.g.
  \verb|http://sample.en/owlim#Organization|) then it is treated as a reference
  to the class (if any) with that URI in the ontology.
\item otherwise, it is treated as a name in the ontology's default namespace.
  The default namespace is prepended to the value to give a URI and the feature
  is treated as referring to the class with that URI.
\end{itemize}
%
For example, if the default namespace of the ontology is
\verb|http://gate.ac.uk/example#| then a {\tt class} feature with the value
``Person'' refers to the \verb|http://gate.ac.uk/example#Person| class in the
ontology.  If the ontology imports other ontologies then it may be useful to
define templates for the various namespace URIs to avoid excessive repetition.
There is an example of this for the PROTON ontology in
section~\ref{sec:jape:templates}.

In ontology-aware mode the matching between two {\tt class} values will not
be based on simple equality but rather hierarchical compatibility. For example
if the ontology contains a class named `{\tt Politician}', which is a sub class
of the class `{\tt Person}', then a pattern of \verb!{Entity.class == `Person'}!
will successfully match an annotation of type {\tt Entity} with a feature {\tt
class} having the value `{\tt Politician}'. If the JAPE transducer were not
ontology-aware, such a test would fail. 

This behaviour allows a larger degree of generalisation when designing a set of
rules. Rules that apply several types of entities mentioned in the text can be
written using the most generic class they apply to and need not be repeated for
each subtype of entity. One could have rules applying to {\tt Location}s without
needing to know whether a particular location happens to be a country or a city.

If a domain ontology is available at the time of building an application, using
it in conjunction with the JAPE transducers can significantly simplify the set
of grammars that need to be written. 

The ontology does not normally affect actions on the right hand side of JAPE
rules, but when Java is used on the right hand side, then the ontology becomes
accessible via a local variable named {\tt ontology}, which may be referenced 
from within the right-hand-side code.

In Java code, the {\tt class} feature should be referenced using the static
final variable, {\tt LOOKUP\_CLASS\_FEATURE\_NAME}, that is defined in {\tt
gate.creole.ANNIEConstants}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect[sec:ontologies:annotation]{Annotating Text with Ontological Information}

The ontology-aware JAPE transducer enables the text to be linked to classes in
an ontology by means of annotations. Essentially this means that each annotation
can have a class and ontology feature. To add the relevant class feature to an
annotation is very easy: simply add a feature `class' with the classname as its
value. To add the relevant ontology, use \texttt {ontology.getURL()}.

Below is a sample rule which looks for a location annotation and identifies it
as a `Mention' annotation with the class `Location' and the ontology loaded with
the ontology-aware JAPE transducer (via the runtime parameter of the
transducer).

\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
Rule: Location

({Location}):mention

-->
:mention{
  // create the ontology and class features
  FeatureMap features = Factory.newFeatureMap();
  features.put("ontology", ontology.getURL());
  features.put("class", "Location");

  // create the new annotation
  try {
    outputAS.add(mentionAnnots.firstNode().getOffset(),
       mentionAnnots.lastNode().getOffset(), "Mention", features);
  }
  catch(InvalidOffsetException e) {
    throw new JapeException(e);
  }
}
\end{verbatim}\end{small}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect[sec:ontologies:api]{Populating Ontologies}

Another typical application that combines the use of ontologies with NLP techniques 
is finding mentions of entities in text. The scenario is that one has an 
existing ontology and wants to use Information Extraction to populate it with 
instances whenever entities belonging to classes in the ontology are mentioned 
in the input texts. 

Let us assume we have an ontology and an IE application that marks the input 
text with annotations of type `{\tt Mention}' having a feature `{\tt class}' 
specifying the class of the entity mentioned. The task we are seeking to solve 
is to add instances in the ontology for every {\tt Mention} annotation.

The example presented here is based on a JAPE rule that uses Java code on the 
action side in order to access directly the GATE ontology API:

\begin{lstlisting}
Rule: FindEntities
({Mention}):mention
-->
:mention{
  //find the annotation matched by LHS
  //we know the annotation set returned
  //will always contain a single annotation
  Annotation mentionAnn = mentionAnnots.iterator().next();
  
  //find the class of the mention
  String className = (String)mentionAnn.getFeatures().
    get(gate.creole.ANNIEConstants.LOOKUP_CLASS_FEATURE_NAME);
  // should normalize class name and avoid invalid class names here!
  OClass aClass = ontology.getOClass(ontology.createOURIForName(className));
  if(aClass == null) { 
    System.err.println("Error class \"" + className + "\" does not exist!");
    return; 
  } 
    
  //find the text covered by the annotation
  String theMentionText = gate.Utils.stringFor(doc, mentionAnn);
  
  // when creating a URI from text that came from a document you must take care
  // to ensure that the name does not contain any characters that are illegal
  // in a URI.  The following method does this nicely for English but you may
  // want to do your own normalization instead if you have non-English text.
  String mentionName = OUtils.toResourceName(theMentionText);

  // get the property to store mention texts for mention instances
  DatatypeProperty prop =
    ontology.getDatatypeProperty(ontology.createOURIForName("mentionText"));

  OURI mentionURI = ontology.createOURIForName(mentionName);
  // if that mention instance does not already exist, add it
  if (!ontology.containsOInstance(mentionURI)) {
    OInstance inst = ontology.addOInstance(mentionURI, aClass);
    // add the actual mention text to the instance
    try {
      inst.addDatatypePropertyValue(prop, 
        new Literal(theMentionText, OConstants.ENGLISH));
    }
    catch(InvalidValueException e) {
      throw new JapeException(e);
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This will match each annotation of type {\tt Mention} in the input and
assign it to a label `{\tt mention}'. That label is then used in the right
hand side to find the annotation that was matched by the pattern (lines
5--10); the value for the {\tt class} feature of the annotation is used to
identify the ontological class name (lines 12--14); and the annotation span
is used to extract the text covered in the document (lines 16--26). Once all
these pieces of information are available, the addition to the ontology can
be done. First the right class in the ontology is identified using the class
name (lines 28--37) and then a new instance for that class is created (lines
38--50).

Beside JAPE, another tool that could play a part in this application is the
Ontological Gazetteer, see Section~\ref{sec:gazetteers:ontogaz}, which can be useful in 
bootstrapping the IE application that finds entity mentions.

The solution presented here is purely pedagogical as it does not address
many issues that would be encountered in a real life application solving the
same problem. For instance, it is na\"{i}ve to assume that the name for the
entity would be exactly the text found in the document. In many cases
entities have several aliases -- for example the same person name can be
written in a variety of forms depending on whether titles, first names, or
initials are used. A process of name normalisation would probably need to be
employed in order to make sure that the same entity, regardless of the
textual form it is mentioned in, will always be linked to the same ontology
instance.

For a detailed description of the GATE ontology API, please
consult the JavaDoc documentation.
