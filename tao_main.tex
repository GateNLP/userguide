% In tex4ht the bibliography is included in the table of contents
% automatically.  In pdflatex it isn't, so we need an explicit addcontentsline
% in that case, but this needs to come after the start of the "chapter" in
% order to get the TOC entry to link to the correct page.  To achieve this we
% redefine the thebibliography environment (in non-HTML mode only) to include
% the addcontentsline at the right place.
