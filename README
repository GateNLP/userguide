The GATE User Guide
-------------------

GG August 09: This is currently the branched version of the user guide while we
work on it in time for Sept 09 release.

This directory contains the GATE User Guide.  The main file for the user guide
is tao_main.tex, look at this file to see what other files are included for the
various chapters.

The HTML and PDF versions of the guide are rebuilt from the .tex sources by a
nightly cron job at Sheffield, so you only need to check in your changes to the
.tex sources.  However, if you want to build the guide yourself for whatever
reason, you must download

http://gate.ac.uk/sale/big.bib

and put it in the directory above this one, i.e. if you are reading this file
in /home/me/gatestuff/userguide then put it at /home/me/gatestuff/big.bib.  You
will also require pdflatex to build the PDF version and tex4ht (htlatex) for
the HTML version, as well as a suitable POSIX shell and GNU Make.  On Windows
the relevant tools are available as part of Cygwin, on Mac OS X you will need
the XCode developer tools and a suitable LaTeX installation (e.g. from Fink),
and for Linux you'll have to refer to the documentation for your distribution.
