The GATE User Guide
-------------------

This directory contains the GATE User Guide.  The main file for the user guide
is tao_main.tex, look at this file to see what other files are included for the
various chapters.

The HTML and PDF versions of the guide are rebuilt from the .tex sources by a
nightly cron job at Sheffield, so you only need to check in your changes to the
.tex sources. 

You will need pdflatex to build the PDF version and tex4ht (htlatex) for
the HTML version, as well as a suitable POSIX shell and GNU Make.  On Windows
the relevant tools are available as part of Cygwin, on Mac OS X you will need
the XCode developer tools and a suitable LaTeX installation (e.g. from Fink),
and for Linux you'll have to refer to the documentation for your distribution.

To build the one page HTML user guide:
`make index.html`

To build the one page per chapter HTML user guide:
`make split.html`

To build the tao.pdf PDF file of the user guide:
`make tao.pdf`

To delete the generated files in case of trouble:
`make clean`

To do all of the previous:
`make`
